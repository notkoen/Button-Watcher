# Button Watcher

A fork of darkerz7's [button watcher](https://github.com/darkerz7/CSGO-Plugins/tree/master/buttonwatcher) plugin. I made several updates and improvements to the plugin since his 2.0 version release. The improvements and changes are outlined below.

Alongside the original plugin from darkerz, I also made a version of button watcher that **does not have button bans.** This is a useful feature to have but not required.

## Improvements

- Cleaned up and improved readability of all plugin messages
- Chat messages now look similar to GFL's button watcher
- Fixed up English grammar and text for both messages and menus
- Added clientprefs for displaying button press messages to both chat and console
- Console button press messages now display origin
- Several optimizations to the plugin throughout
